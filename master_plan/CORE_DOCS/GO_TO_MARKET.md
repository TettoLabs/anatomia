# Go To Market

How to launch, get users, and grow.

---

## GTM Philosophy

### Principle: Build in Public, Launch Incrementally

1. **No big bang launch** - Soft launch, iterate, then amplify
2. **Dogfood extensively** - Use it ourselves first
3. **Community-first** - Open source core, build community
4. **Developer-to-developer** - We're devs building for devs

---

## Pre-Launch: Dogfooding (Weeks 1-4)

### Internal Usage

**Use Anatomia on:**
1. Anatomia itself (meta!)
2. IRIS2 framework
3. ATLAS3 framework
4. Any active side projects
5. Work projects (if appropriate)

**Goals:**
- Find bugs before users do
- Refine the onboarding experience
- Generate real example outputs
- Build testimonial content

### Documentation and Examples

**Create:**
- Beautiful README with GIF
- Example .ana/ outputs for Python, Node, Go
- "How it works" walkthrough
- Comparison with alternatives

---

## Soft Launch: Friends & Dev Communities (Weeks 5-6)

### Direct Outreach

**Who:**
- Developer friends (10-15 people)
- Twitter mutuals who use AI tools
- Discord communities for AI coding

**Ask:**
- "Would you try this on a real project?"
- "What's confusing?"
- "What's missing?"

**Goal:** 20-30 real users providing feedback

### Small Community Posts

**Reddit:**
- r/ClaudeAI (most relevant)
- r/cursor (if they allow promotion)
- r/ChatGPTPro

**Discord:**
- Claude community
- Cursor community
- AI dev communities

**Approach:** Share genuinely, not spammy. "I built this to solve X, would love feedback."

---

## Public Launch: Hacker News (Week 7)

### HN Strategy

**Title options:**
- "Anatomia – AI that understands your codebase"
- "Show HN: I built a context layer for AI coding assistants"
- "Anatomia – Smart context and modes for Claude Code/Cursor"

**Post timing:**
- Tuesday-Thursday
- 9am-11am EST
- Avoid holidays

**Post content:**
- Brief problem statement
- What Anatomia does
- Technical approach (interesting for HN)
- Open source, free to try
- Looking for feedback

**Comment strategy:**
- Be responsive (first few hours critical)
- Answer technical questions deeply
- Accept criticism gracefully
- Share roadmap when asked

### Day-of Checklist

- [ ] GitHub repo polished
- [ ] README perfect
- [ ] Demo GIF working
- [ ] Landing page live
- [ ] Monitor HN for comments
- [ ] Have examples ready to share

---

## Ongoing: Content Marketing

### Blog Content (anatomia.dev/blog)

**Week 1-4 posts:**
1. "Why your AI coding assistant doesn't understand your codebase"
2. "Modes vs Monolithic prompts: A better way to use Claude Code"
3. "How we built Anatomia with ATLAS (our own framework)"

**Ongoing posts:**
- Case studies (user stories)
- Framework-specific guides (FastAPI, Next.js, etc.)
- Comparisons (vs CLAUDE.md, vs custom prompts)
- Technical deep dives

### Twitter/X Strategy

**Content types:**
- Development updates (build in public)
- Tips for using AI assistants better
- Anatomia feature announcements
- User testimonials/quotes
- Memes about AI coding pain points

**Frequency:** 3-5 tweets/week

**Engagement:**
- Reply to AI coding discussion
- Quote tweet relevant topics
- Participate in dev communities

### YouTube (Optional, High Effort)

**Video ideas:**
- "Setting up Anatomia in 2 minutes"
- "How Anatomia's learning engine works"
- "From CLAUDE.md to Anatomia: A migration guide"

- Emphasize open source (not locked in)
- Emphasize community (mode marketplace)
- Move upmarket (team/enterprise features)

### If Cursor Builds This

**Our response:**
- Emphasize works with any tool
- Emphasize portability

- **Community:** Build ecosystem around .ana/
- **Open source:** Hard to compete with free
- **Enterprise:** Features they won't prioritize

*This is how we get users. Now let's look at what we still need to figure out.*
