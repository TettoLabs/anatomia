# Anatomia Context - anatomia

This directory contains AI context for the **anatomia** codebase. The `.ana/` folder helps AI assistants understand your project faster and work more effectively.

---

## What is .ana/?

The `.ana/` directory structure:

```
.ana/
├── ENTRY.md           # This file - orientation contract
├── node.json          # Project identity and metadata
├── context/
│   ├── main.md        # Project overview and architecture
│   ├── patterns.md    # Detected code patterns
│   └── conventions.md # Coding conventions and style
└── modes/
    ├── architect.md   # System design and architecture
    ├── code.md        # Feature implementation
    ├── debug.md       # Debugging and troubleshooting
    ├── docs.md        # Documentation writing
    └── test.md        # Test writing and coverage
```

## 5 Modes (Task-Specific AI Context)

Use `ana mode <name>` to reference mode-specific guidance:

1. **architect** - System design and architecture decisions (NOT implementation)
2. **code** - Day-to-day feature implementation and coding (NOT architecture)
3. **debug** - Debugging and root cause analysis (NOT new features)
4. **docs** - Documentation writing (NOT code creation)
5. **test** - Test writing and coverage (NOT implementation)

**Mode boundaries are STRICT.** Each mode has a specific purpose. Architect designs, code implements. Don't mix.

---

## 7 Non-Negotiable Principles

1. **Mode boundaries are STRICT** - Never mix modes. Architect mode designs but does NOT implement. Code mode implements but does NOT design. Each mode has explicit constraints.

2. **Context is living documentation** - Keep `context/main.md` updated as your project evolves. Outdated context misleads AI and wastes time.

3. **Conventions prevent bikeshedding** - Document decisions in `context/conventions.md` (naming, formatting, testing). Once documented, follow them. Don't re-debate.

4. **Patterns are reusable** - Detected patterns go in `context/patterns.md` (error handling, data flow, abstractions). Reuse patterns, don't reinvent.

5. **Tests are non-negotiable** - Use `test.md` for ALL test-related work. Aim for ≥80% coverage. Tests catch bugs before production.

6. **Documentation is first-class** - Use `docs.md` for ALL documentation. READMEs, API docs, guides. Docs = code quality.

7. **Architecture before implementation** - Use `architect.md` before `code.md`. Design first, implement second. Prevents rework from unclear requirements.

## How to Use Modes

**Reference a mode in your AI chat:**
```bash
# CLI command (if using terminal)
ana mode architect

# Or reference directly (if using IDE)
Read .ana/modes/architect.md before starting
```

**Workflow:**
1. Choose mode based on task (designing? → architect, coding? → code)
2. Read mode file (understand constraints and examples)
3. Work within mode boundaries (respect what mode produces vs delegates)
4. Switch modes when task changes (design complete? → switch to code mode)

---

## Safety Guidelines

**Before making large changes:**
- Changes affecting >100 lines of code → Discuss with team first
- Adding new dependencies or frameworks → Propose in architecture mode
- Modifying core architecture → Design in architect mode, get approval

**When uncertain:**
- Check `context/patterns.md` for existing patterns (don't reinvent)
- Check `context/conventions.md` for style guidelines (follow them)
- Ask for clarification (better than guessing)
